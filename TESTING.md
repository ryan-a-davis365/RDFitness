## **During Development Testing**
During the development process, I was manually testing in the following ways:-

1. Manually testing each element for appearance and responsiveness via a simulated live server using an extension in VSCode.
    
1. Published the page via GitHub pages and made sure everything was working well on the officially published page.

### ***Manual Testing:***
* During testing, I used four different browsers to ensure cross-compatibility. The desktop browsers used by myself were:

  1. Chrome
  2. Firefox
  3. Edge

* I then used the devtools to simulate different screen sizes/devices from 320 px up to 4000px in width. 
* In addition to this, I also asked several people to test using iPhones and Apple Mac laptops/desktops using safari. These users reported no issues or bugs only style suggestions.
